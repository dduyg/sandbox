British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC), acting as the Global Center for The Nippon Foundation-GEBCO (General Bathymetric Chart of the Ocean) Seabed 2030 Project, archived these data with the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis in 2025. For the GEBCO 2025 release, all file formats and grid types are included as part of the published data holding. The citation for these data should read:
